# Getting Started  

Welcome to the first lesson! In this lesson, you are going to focus on getting started as a developer. Being a developer requires more than just writing code. You'll need to learn how the web works, where to write your code, how to organize your files, where to find answers, and so much more.

In this lesson, to get you started, you will learn:

- Hour 1: [Course Intro and How the Web Works](#course-intro-and-how-the-web-works)    
- Hour 2: Code Editors and Project Folder Structure   
- Hour 3: Intro to HTML  

Below is an outline of the topics you learn about in the live session. After the session, you can use this material as a resource for guided self-learning. The outline and links within it serve as a roadmap or learning path for gaining repitition with the material that you learn in the live session. 

Also included in this repository is some of the code that you see in the live session. After class, you can review the code, modify it for your own projects, and save it as a template for use later.

## [Hour 1: Course Intro and How the Web Works](#course-intro-and-how-the-web-works)  
  
  ### Course Intro (see course info repo)
  
  In the Google Classroom, you should find a link to the course information. Please review it carefully for information about this First Steps Program.
  
  ### How the Web Works
  
  - Browser  
    -- [Domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name)  
    -- [Hosting Provider IP Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) 
    -- [DNS Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)  
    -- [Hosting provider server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service)  
    -- Files displayed by browser  
    -- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
    -- You will learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this program  
  - Server  
    -- Runs on a machine (it listens for incoming requests)  
    -- Communicates with browsers, other servers, and databases  
    -- Has routes that receive requests and send responses  
    -- A route is like a server address (is not the same as a domain name or url)  
    -- Browser sends request to server (or one server sends request to another server)  
    -- Server responds with a response  
    -- Server can create, update, read, and delete data from databases  
    -- Servers are written in many languages (two common ones are Node.js and Python)  
    -- In the ITC Fullstsack bootcamp, you build your own servers and communicate with third-party servers  
    -- In this program, you will interact with third-party servers when learning about asynchronous code  
  - HTTP  
    -- Requests  
    -- Responses  
    -- JSON  
    -- You will work with these in this program
  
## Hour 2: Code Editors and Project Folder Structure  
  - VS Code  
    -- [Download it](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
    -- Practice opening a project folder in VS Code  
    -- Practice creating a new file in your root folder, subfolder in your root folder, and file in your subfolder  
    -- Practice renaming files and dragging from folder to folder  
    -- Explore the split screen, terminal, and settings  
    -- Search files
    -- Open HTML file in browser
  - VS Code Extensions  
    -- Can install extensions to enhance your coding experience
    -- One example: Prettier Code Formatter
      --- Install it  
      --- In VS Code settings, search for "format" and choose "format on save"
  - Folder Structures and File Paths
    -- Example of HTML, CSS, JS [folder structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files)  
    -- [File paths](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp) 

## Hour 3: Intro to HTML  
  - HTML is a document  
    -- Look at the [inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) in your web browser 
    -- What do you see in the elements tab?
    -- Do you see HTML?
    -- What happens if you change the text inside an HTML tag?
    -- Can you find another tab in the inspector where the source code files are accessible?
    -- Explore what else you see in the inspector
  - HTML Tags Examples
    -- Look at [W3 Schools HTML Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) for an example of how HTML page is organized
    -- Learn about [HTML elements generally](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp)  
    -- Explore [basic element types](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp)  
    -- Here is a list of [HTML tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)
  - HTML is used in combination with CSS for style
    -- Import stylesheets for CSS in the [HTML head tag](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_head.asp)
  - HTML is used in combination with JavaScript for functionality
    -- Import scripts into your HTML using the [script tag](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_scripts.asp) inside the HTML body at the bottom

# Getting Started  
Hour 1: How the web works  
  
  - Browser  
    -- Domain name  
    -- IP Address  
    -- DNS Server  
    -- Hosting provider  
    -- Files displayed by browser  
    -- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
    -- You will learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
  - Server  
    -- Runs on a machine (it listens for incoming requests)  
    -- Communicates with browsers, other servers, and databases  
    -- Has routes that receive requests and send responses  
    -- A route is like a server address (is not the same as a domain name or url)  
    -- Browser sends request to server (or one server sends request to another server)  
    -- Server responds with a response  
    -- Server can create, update, read, and delete data from databases  
    -- Servers are written in many languages. Two common ones are Node.js and Python  
    -- In the ITC Fullstsack bootcamp, you build your own servers and communicate with third-party servers  
    -- In this program, you will interact with third-party servers when learning about asynchronous code  
  - HTTP  
    -- Requests  
    -- Responses  
    -- JSON  
  
Hour 2: Code Editors and Project Folder Structure  
  - VS Code  
  - VS Code Plugins  
  - Example of HTML, CSS, JS folder structure  
  - Relative paths  
  
Hour 3: Intro to HTML  
  - HTML is a document  
  - Look at the [inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) in your web browser 
    -- What do you see in the elements tab?
    -- Do you see HTML?
    -- What happens if you change the text inside an HTML tag?
    -- Can you find another tab in the inspector where the source code files are accessible?
  - Uses tag-based syntax to display items on page
  - Look at [W3 Schools HTML Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) to learn about the basic tag types
  - HTML is used in combination with CSS for style and JavaScript for functionality
